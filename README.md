# STAD94 Statistics Project
This project investigates the impact of electric vehicles on various pollutant levels (CO2, CO, SOX, NOX, VOC, GHG) and health conditions (e.g. heart disease, asthma) in 34 countries using data was from government databases, car associations, and the World Health Organization. Linear and non-linear regression models were built to describe and extrapolate the pollution trends associated with electric vehicles. Due to the time restraints for this project, a limited amount of work was done to explore the health aspects of this issue.

This project was done for a fourth-year course, STAD94 Statistics Project, at the University of Toronto during my undergraduate studies and was made possible by the generosity of Dr. Ken Butler who supervised me throughout the process.
